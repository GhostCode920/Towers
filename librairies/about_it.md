## config.yml
The default config.
A config for 4 players on the map in [Towers_Map.zip](https://github.com/GhostCode920/Towers/blob/main/librairies/Towers_Map.zip)

## GameAPI.jar
The API I created and used to make the game.
You don't need to install it to use the plugin.

## lombok.jar
Used to have the @Getter, @Setter, @AllArgsConstructor... classes and make the code cleaner. 
You will need it if you want to edit the code.

## spigot.jar
The spigot build I use. It is 1.8.8.

## Towers.jar
It contains the compiled plugin.
All librairies are already in (GameAPI too, you don't need it on your server for it to works)

## Towers_Map.zip
The Map used for the Game with the [default config](https://github.com/GhostCode920/Towers/blob/main/librairies/config.yml).
