# Towers
The Towers is a mini-game from BadBlock made by myself, GhostCode, to make my friend happy. I'm not trolling it is true lol.
He asked me if I could recreate it, I finally accepted.
This project is finally here after... 2 days of work WOW GG MYSELF!

## What is the goal?
The goal? Go in the opposite "goal", a little hole.
You have chests all around the map (not on the map you can download below, because my friend finds them "too OP", why not), with stuff in. Use it to go to the other base, kill enemies, do your chores...
Once you have 5 points (not in the actual version, later) you win!
It's that easy.
You can break any block on the map, place any block... You're free.

## How to install it?
- Have a spigot server
- Download the plugin from here (i'll add a link later)
- Place it into your plugins folder
- Restart your server
- Edit the config as you want
- Restart your server
- Do /join and play with your friends (if you have some)

## What librairies am I using?
I am using Spigot 1.8.8, lombok and GameAPI made by myself.
I will add them in this repository later.
