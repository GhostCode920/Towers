The Towers is a mini-game from BadBlock (aka. Blitz from FunCraft)

## What is the goal?
Go in the opposite team's goal, a little hole.

You have chests around the map, you can use the stuff inside them to go to the other base, kill enemies, do your goal...

You can break any block on the map, place any block, as long as it's not next to a goal.
