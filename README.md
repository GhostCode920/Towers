The Towers is a mini-game from BadBlock (aka. Blitz from FunCraft)

## What is the goal?
Go in the opposite team's goal, a little hole.

You have chests around the map, you can use the stuff inside them to go to the other base, kill enemies, do your goal...

You can break any block on the map, place any block, as long as it's not next to a goal.

## How to install it
1. Install Spigot on your server
2. Download the plugin from [here](https://github.com/Ghosty920/Towers/releases/latest).
3. Place it into your plugins folder
4. Optional: Download the default map from [here](https://github.com/Ghosty920/Towers/blob/main/files/Map.zip) and place it in your server worlds.
5. Optional: Download the default config (for the map above) from [here](https://github.com/Ghosty920/Towers/blob/main/files/config.yml) and place it in `plugins/Towers/`.
6. (Re)Start your server
